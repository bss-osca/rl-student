# Temporal difference methods for prediction {#mod-td-pred}

One of the most fundamental concepts in reinforcement learning is temporal difference (TD) learning. TD learning is a combination of Monte Carlo (MC) and dynamic programming (DP) ideas: Like MC, TD can predict using a model-free environment and learn from experience. Like DP, TD update estimates based on other learned estimates, without waiting for a final outcome (bootstrap). That is, TD can learn on-line and do not need to wait until the whole sample-path is found. TD is in general learn more efficiently than MC due to bootstrapping. In this module prediction using TD is considered.

## What is TD learning?

Given a policy $\pi$, we want to estimate the state-value function. Recall that the state value function is 
\[
v_\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_\pi[G_t | S_t = s].
\]
where the return is 
\[
G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \cdots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1} = R_{t+1} + \gamma G_{t+1}
\]

Let $V$ denote the state-value estimate. Under MC prediction we used an incremental update formula:
$$
  V(S_t) \leftarrow V(S_t) + \alpha_n\left[G_t - V(S_t)\right],
$$
where $n$ denote the number of observations and $\alpha_n$ the step-size. Different values of $\alpha_n$ was discussed in Module \@ref(mod-mc). Here we assumed a stationary environment (state set, transition probabilities etc. is the same for each stage $t$) e.g. for the sample average $\alpha_n = 1/n$. If the environment is non-stationary (e.g. transition probabilities change over time) then a fixed step-size may be appropriate. Let us for the remaining of this module consider a non-stationary process with fixed step-size:
$$
  V(S_t) \leftarrow V(S_t) + \alpha\left[G_t - V(S_t)\right],
$$

Note as pointed out in Section \@ref(sec-bandit-step-size), a fixed step-size corresponds to a weighted average of the past observed returns and the initial estimate of $S_t$:
$$
\begin{align}
V_{n+1} &= V_n +\alpha \left[G_n - V_n\right] \nonumber \\
&= \alpha G_n + (1 - \alpha)V_n \nonumber \\
&= \alpha G_n + (1 - \alpha)[\alpha G_{n-1} + (1 - \alpha)V_{n-1}] \nonumber \\
&= \alpha G_n + (1 - \alpha)\alpha G_{n-1} + (1 - \alpha)^2 V_{n-1}  \nonumber \\
& \vdots \nonumber \\
&= (1-\alpha)^n V_1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha (1 - \alpha)^{n-i} G_i \\
\end{align}
$$
That is, a larger weight is used for recent observations compared to old observations. 

For MC prediction we needed the sample path to get the realized return $G_t$. However, since 
$$
\begin{align}
v_\pi(s) &= \mathbb{E}_\pi[G_t | S_t = s] \\
         &= \mathbb{E}_\pi[R_{t+1} + \gamma G_{t+1} | S_t = s] \\
         &= \mathbb{E}_\pi[R_{t+1}| S_t = s] + \gamma \mathbb{E}_\pi[G_{t+1} | S_t = s] \\
         &= \mathbb{E}_\pi[R_{t+1}| S_t = s] + \gamma v_\pi(S_{t+1}),
\end{align}
$$ 
then, given a realized reward $R_{t+1}$, an estimate for the return $G_t$ is $R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1})$ and the incremental update becomes:
$$
  V(S_t) \leftarrow V(S_t) + \alpha\left[R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)\right].
  (\#eq:td0)
$$
As a result, we do not have to generate a whole sample-path (as for MC) for updating the state-value estimate of $s = S_t$ to $V(S_t)$. Instead we only have to wait until the next state is observed and update the estimate of $S_t$ given the estimate of the next state $S_{t+1}$. As the estimate of $S_{t+1}$ improve the estimate of $S_t$ also improve. The incremental update in Eq. \@ref(eq:td0) is called *TD(0)* or one-step TD because it use a one-step lookahead to update the estimate. Note updating the estimates using TD resembles the way we did for DP:
$$
V(s = S_t) \leftarrow \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}\pi(a | s)\left( r(s,a) + \gamma\sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) V(s')\right) 
$$
Here we updated the value by considering the expectation of all the next states. This was possible since we had a model. Now, by using TD, we do not need a model to estimate the state-value. 

The term 
$$
\delta_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t),
$$
is denoted the *temporal difference error* (*TD error*) since it is the difference between the current estimate $V(S_t)$ and the better estimate $R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1})$.


## TD prediction

We can now formulate a TD(0) algorithm for predicting state-values of a policy (see Figure \@ref(fig:td0-pred-alg)). No stopping criterion is given but could stop when small differences in state-values are observed. 

```{r td0-pred-alg, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="TD(0) policy prediction [@Sutton18]."}
knitr::include_graphics("img/td0-pred.png")
```

The algorithm is given for a process with episodes; however, also works for continuing processes. In this case the inner loop runs over an infinite number of time-steps.

### TD prediction for action-values

Later we will use TD to for improving the policy (control). Since we do not have a model we need to estimate action-values instead and the optimal policy can be found using $q_*$ (see Eq. \@ref(eq:bell-opt-state-policy)). To find $q_*$, we first need to predict action-values for a policy $\pi$ and the incremental update Eq. \@ref(eq:td0) must be modified to use $Q$ values: 
$$
  Q(S_t, A_t) \leftarrow Q(S_t, A_t) + \alpha\left[R_{t+1} + \gamma Q(S_{t+1}, A_t) - Q(S_t, A_t)\right].
$$

Note given a policy $\pi$ you need to know $S_t, A_t, R_{t+1}, S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}$ or short SARSA before you can make an update. This acronym is used to name the SARSA algorithm for control in Module \@ref(mod-td-control). Note to ensure exploration of all action-values we need e.g. an $\epsilon$-soft behavioural policy.  


## Benefits of TD methods

Let us try to summarize the benefits of TD prediction

* TD methods do not require a model of the environment (compared to DP).
* TD methods can be implemented online, which can speed convergence (compared to MC methods which must wait until the end of the sample-path).
* TD methods learn from all actions, whereas MC methods require the sample-path to have a tail equal to the target policy. 
* TD methods do converge on the value function with a sufficiently small step-size parameter, or with a decreasing step-size.
* TD methods generally converge faster than MC methods, although this has not been formally proven.
* TD methods are extremely useful for continuing tasks that cannot be broken down into episodes as required by MC methods.
* TD can be seen as a method for *prediction learning* where you try to predict what happens next given you current action, get new information and make a new prediction. That is, you do not need a training set (as in supervised learning) instead the reward signal is observed as time goes by. 
* TD methods are good for sequential decision problems (multi-step prediction).
* TD methods are scalable in the sense that computations do not grow exponentially with the problem size.       

An example illustrating that TD methods converge faster than MC methods is given in Exercise \@ref(ex-td-pred-random)

## Exercises



### Exercise - A randow walk {#ex-td-pred-random}

Consider a MDP with states 2-6 and two terminal states 1 and 7. Possible transitions are given in Figure \@ref(fig:rw-trans). All episodes start in the centre state, 4, then proceed either left or right by one state on each step. We assume the stochastic policy $\pi$ is used where each direction has equal probability. Episodes terminate either on the left (1) or the right (7). When an episode terminates on the right, reward of 1 occurs; all other rewards are zero. If the discount factor equals 1, the state-value of each state is the probability of terminating on the right if starting from that state. 

```{r rw-trans, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.height=1, fig.width=6, fig.cap = "Possible transitions between states and rewards."}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
edges <- tibble(
  from = str_c(1:6),
  to = str_c(2:7),
  reward = c(rep(0,5), 1)
)
gr <- as_tbl_graph(edges)
ggraph(gr, layout = "linear") +
   geom_edge_link(aes(label = reward, vjust = -1.1)) +
   geom_node_label(aes(label = name, colour = name)) +
   theme_graph(background = NULL, 
               plot_margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0)) +
   theme(legend.position = "none") 
```


<!-- Q1 -->


1) Formulate the MDP model and calculate the state-value $v_\pi$ for each state using the Bellman equations \@ref(eq:bm-pol-eval). Hint: there is no need to code this. Just solve the Bellman equations for state 2-6. 


<!-- Q2 -->
2) Consider the code below which build, set the policy and evaluate it. Try to understand what happens and check if the results are the same as found in Question 1.

```{r ref.label='MDP-class', include=FALSE}
```

```{r}
## Build the MDP
mdp <- MDPClass$new()
mdp$addStateSpace(1:7)   # add state keys
states <- str_c(2:6)
for (s in states) {
      mdp$addActionSpace(s, c("left", "right"))
}
mdp$addActionSpace("1", c("dummy"))
mdp$addActionSpace("7", c("dummy"))
# Add trans pr and rewards
pr <- 1
for (s in 2:5) {
   names(pr) = s+1
   mdp$addAction(as.character(s), "right", r = 0, pr)
}
mdp$addAction("6", "right", r = 1, pr = c("7" = 1))
for (s in 2:6) {
   names(pr) = s-1 
   mdp$addAction(as.character(s), "left", r = 0, pr)
}
mdp$addAction("1", "dummy", r = 0, pr = c("1" = 1))
mdp$addAction("7", "dummy", r = 0, pr = c("7" = 1))
mdp$getActionInfo("1")
mdp$getActionInfo("2")
mdp$getActionInfo("6")
mdp$getActionInfo("7")
## Set the policy
pi = c("left" = 0.5, "right" = 0.5)
mdp$setPolicy(states, pi)
pi = c("dummy" = 1)
mdp$setPolicy(c("1", "7"), pi)
mdp$getPolicy()
## Evaluate the policy
mdp$policyEval(gamma = 1)
mdp$getStateValues()
```


<!-- Q3 -->


3) Consider an episode with sequence $4, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 1$. Let the initial state-value estimates of state 2-6 be 0.5 and update the state-values using TD(0) with $\alpha = 0.1$. It appears that only $V(2)$ change why was only the estimate for this one state changed? By exactly how much was it changed?


<!-- Q4 -->
4) Generate 100 episodes and run the TD(0) prediction algorithm with $\alpha = 0.1$ (see Figure \@ref(fig:td0-pred-alg)). Make a plot of the state-value estimate (y-axis) given state 2-6 (x-axis) for TD(0) running for 1, 10 and 100 episodes. You may use the code below as a starting point.

First we need an environment representing the problem

```{r}
library(R6)
library(hash)
library(tidyverse)

#' R6 Class representing the RL environment for the problem
RLEnvRandom <- R6Class("RLEnvRandom",
   public = list(
      #' @description Return all states (keys).
      getStates = function() {
         return(str_c(1:7))
      },
      
      #' @description Return all actions (keys) for a state.
      #' @param s State considered.
      getActions = function(s) {
         if (s == "1" | s == "7") return("dummy")
         return(c("left", "right"))
      },
      
      #' @description Returns an episode as a tibble with cols s, a, r (last col the terminal reward).
      #' @param agent The agent that holds the model with current policy stored in pi. 
      getEpisodePi = function(agent, startState) {
         if (startState == "1" | startState == "7") {
            return(tibble::tibble(!!!c("s", "a", "r"), .rows = 0))  # empty tibble
         }
         s <- as.numeric(startState)
         df <- tibble(s = rep(NA_character_, 1000), a = NA_character_, r = NA_real_)  # a tibble with more rows than used
         for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
            if (s == 1 | s == 7) {
               df <- df[1:(i-1),]  # remove unused rows
               break  # have reached terminal state
            }
            r <- 0
            a <- agent$getActionPi(str_c(s))
            if (s == 6 & a == "right") r = 1
            df$s[i] <- s
            df$a[i] <- a
            df$r[i] <- r
            if (a == "right") s <- s + 1
            if (a == "left") s <- s - 1
          }
         return(df)
      },
      
      #' @description Returns next state and reward given current state and action in a list (with names `r` and `sN`).
      #' @param s Current state.
      #' @param a Current action.
      getTimeStepData = function(s, a) {
         s <- as.numeric(s)
         if (a == "left" & s > 1 & s < 7) return(list(r = 0, sN = as.character(s-1)))
         if (a == "right" & s > 1 & s < 7) {
            if (s == 6) return(list(r = 1, sN = as.character(s+1)))
            return(list(r = 0, sN = as.character(s+1)))
         }
         if ((s == 1 | s == 7) & a == "dummy") return(list(r = 0, sN = NA_character_))
         stop("Error finding next state and reward!")
      }
      
      
   )
)
env <- RLEnvRandom$new()
env$getTimeStepData("3", "right")
env$getTimeStepData("1", "dummy")
env$getTimeStepData("6", "right")
```

Note we define a method `getTimeStepData` that takes a state and action and return the reward and next state. This method is used by the RL agent class in method `policyEvalTD0`:

```{r ref.label='RLAgent', include=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
```

We can now define the RL agent and set the policy which must be done before calling TD(0):

```{r}
agent <- RLAgent$new()
agent$addStates(env$getStates())   # add states
for (s in agent$getStateKeys()) {  # add actions
   agent$addActions(s, env$getActions(s))
} 
## Set the policy
states <- str_c(2:6)
pi = c("left" = 0.5, "right" = 0.5)
agent$setPolicy(states, pi)
pi = c("dummy" = 1)
agent$setPolicy(c("1", "7"), pi)
agent$getPolicy()
```

Note a policy must be defined for each possible state that may be generated in an episode. We can now run TD(0):

```{r}
set.seed(875)
## One episode
agent$setStateValue(states, 0.5)
agent$setStateValue(c("1", "7"), 0)
agent$getStateValues()
agent$policyEvalTD0(env, gamma = 1, states = "4", maxE = 1, reset = F)
resTD0 <- agent$getStateValues() %>% mutate(episodes = 1) %>% print()
```



Note we first have to set the state-values to the default specified. Next, we run TD(0) prediction with one episode `maxE = 1` and starting state 4. You now have to run similar code for 10 and 100 episodes, store the result and plot a line for each result. 


<!-- Q5 -->


5) Run an MC prediction algorithm with $\alpha = 0.1$ (see Figure \@ref(fig:mc-prediction-alg) running for 1, 10 and 100 episodes. Hint you have to call `policyEvalMC` instead of `policyEvalTD0`.


<!-- Q6 -->
6) Let us join the results for TD(0) and MC and calculate the root mean square (RMS) error $$\sqrt{\frac{1}{5}\sum_{s=2}^6(V(s)-v_\pi(s))^2}$$.
```{r}
resMDP <- mdp$getStateValues() %>% mutate(state = as.numeric(state)) %>% rename(vMDP = v) %>%  print()
res <- bind_rows(resTD0, resMC) %>% 
   filter(episodes != "mdp") %>% 
   left_join(resMDP) %>% 
   group_by(episodes, alg, alpha) %>% 
   summarise(rms = sqrt(0.2 * sum(v-vMDP)^2)) %>% 
   print()
```

Which algorithm is best in estimating the state-values? Explain.


<!-- Q7 -->

7) The results are dependent on the value of the step-size parameter. Let us estimate the state-values using TD(0) for $\alpha = 0.1, 0.2$ and 0.5 and plot the root mean square (RMS) error given the number of episodes:

```{r}
set.seed(98)
res <- NULL
for (run in 1:20) {
   for (alpha in c(0.1, 0.2, 0.5)) {
      agent$setStateValue(states, 0.5)
      agent$setStateValue(c("1", "7"), 0)
      eOld <- 0
      for (e in c(1,seq(5, 100, by = 5))) {
         agent$policyEvalTD0(env, gamma = 1, states = "4", maxE = e - eOld, alpha = alpha, reset = F)
         eOld <- e
         res <- bind_rows(res, agent$getStateValues() %>% mutate(episodes = e, alpha = alpha, run = run))
      }
   }
}
resMDP <- mdp$getStateValues() %>% rename(vMDP = v)
left_join(res, resMDP) %>% 
   group_by(episodes, alpha, run) %>% 
   summarise(rms = sqrt(0.2 * sum((v-vMDP)^2))) %>% 
   group_by(episodes, alpha) %>%
   summarize(rms = mean(rms)) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = episodes, y = rms, col = factor(alpha))) +
   geom_line()

```

Explain the plot. 

```{r links, child="links.md", include=FALSE}
```
